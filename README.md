The laptop given to me was made in late 1990s. I call it "GrandmaDell". 
Can you open the case and tell me the difference between modern day laptops and old laptops?

You need to list component by component comparison.

CPU: manufactuer? More information.
RAM: How big, who made it?
Hard drive: How big in terms of storage space? who made it?

How is laptop different from desktop?
